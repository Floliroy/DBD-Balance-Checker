FEEL FREE TO CHANGE THIS FILE FOR YOUR COMMIT IF YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING IN GREATER DETAIL.

- Removed the balancing/perk loading functionality from local storage (Kept the code, just commented. If this becomes requested in the future or makes more sense in my design soon I feel like it could be dope!)
- Changed the "already equipped" perk colour to more closely match Dead by Daylight's "Very Rare"
- Added text to indicate whether a perk is equipped, banned, or free on perk search
- Moved nonBanned event to go into the settings event function for organization
- Added a clear storage button in settings just in case any storage bugs arise.
- Added custom balancing to saves.
- Added indicator to show if a perk was equipped AND banned.
- Added transition effects to perk search selection.
- Added subtle outline to perks in search on hover, it's barely noticable but it's there.
