Name:
    checker-events.js
Purpose:
    This file is designed for the purpose of handling all of the event setup for the balance checker.
    Many of the methods in this file are designed to only be called once. This is to prevent multiple event listeners from being added to the same element.
    Please see the method mapper for more information.
